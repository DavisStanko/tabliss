# My Gruvbox Tabliss Configuration

## Author's Note

This fork does very little apart from changing the colors used in the CSS file, adding a clock, and opting to hide the settings icon when it's not hovered. I strongly recommend using the original project [stationaryStation/tabliss](https://github.com/stationaryStation/tabliss) unless you want a gruvbox theme. The original project has custom fonts and it's CSS affects the settings pane unlike mine.

## Setup

### How to install custom css on tabliss

Go to settings and add the "Custom CSS" widget. Then copy the contents of main.css to the little box inside the configuration.
